        This email is cryptographically signed using S/MIME. You should expect all future emails
        to also be signed, and to originate from this email address. If you receive an email
        that isn't signed, or that comes from a different address, it's likely to be malicious.
        For information about how to validate the S/MIME signature, see the help page on the
        Standard Notes website FAQ.

      We will never send anything other than a <code>txt</code> file
      as part of your daily backups. To protect yourself against phishing attacks, never open
      any other kind of file, and always open the <code>txt</code> file with a text editor to
      verify its contents before decrypting.

    <li>
      We will never include clickable links in this email. Instead, manually verify
      and copy/paste the offline link above in your browser.
